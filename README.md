# Universal-System-Balance
Universal framework for balancing Order and Chaos via the 0.707 invariant. It detects critical 'jerk' points (d3x/dt3=0) where systems transition between states. By skeletonizing data at the ζc threshold, it enables real-time stability in AI, Fusion Energy, and complex dynamics. The geometry of balance.
